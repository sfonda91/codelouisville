/// This is the repository for the Code Louiville Front-End Web Development final project 

I have created a Freelance Web Developer Portfolio with an HTML, CSS, and JS file. 

To run this program, issue a pull request and run on your local environment. 

/// Make sure the CSS, JS, and IMG files are in their own individual folders labeled as such: "css" "js" "img"
/// Drag and drop the index.html file into your favorite browser (preferablly Chrome), and view my site! 

Active JS on the page is a lightbox that opens with the image is clicked. Click anywhere on the lightbox to close it.
